[HDiffPatch] is a C\C++ library and command-line tools for **diff** & **patch** between binary files or directories(folder); cross-platform; fast running; create small delta/differential; support large files and limit memory requires when diff & patch.   

[HDiffPatch] defines its own patch file format, this lib is also compatible with the [bsdiff4] & [endsley/bsdiff] patch file format and [compatible](https://github.com/sisong/HDiffPatch/issues/369#issuecomment-1869798843) with the [open-vcdiff] & [xdelta3] patch file format [VCDIFF(RFC 3284)].   

if need patch (OTA) on embedded systems,MCU,NB-IoT..., see demo [HPatchLite], with [tinyuz] decompressor can run on 1KB RAM devices! HPatchLite also supports a simple inplace-patch implementation to support storage-constrained devices.   

update your own Android Apk? Jar or Zip file diff & patch? try [ApkDiffPatch], to create smaller delta/differential! NOTE: *ApkDiffPatch can't be used by Android app store, because it requires re-signing apks before diff.*   

[sfpatcher] not require re-signing apks (like [archive-patcher]), is designed for Android app store, create smaller patch file for apk, patch speed up by a factor of xx than archive-patcher & run with O(1) memory.   

if you not have the old versions(too many or not obtain or have been modified), thus cannot create the delta in advance.
you can see sync demo [hsynz] (like [zsync]), the new version is only need released once,
and the owners of the old version get the information about the new version and do the diff&patch themselves.
hsynz support zstd compressor & run much faster than zsync; also compatible with the zsync's file format.   
additional, if you have the new file locally & not the old file, but can get a hash certificate file(.hsyni) of the old file,
you can also create a hpatchz format patch file(usage scenario like [rsync]); see the demo cmdline **hsign_diff** in [hsynz].   
   
NOTE: *This library does not deal with file metadata, such as file last write time, permissions, link file, etc... To this library, a file is just as a stream of bytes; You can extend this library or use other tools.*

## Releases/Binaries
[Download from latest release](https://github.com/sisong/HDiffPatch/releases) : Command line app for Windows, Linux, MacOS; and .so patch lib for Android.   
use cmdline to create a delta:   
`$hdiffz oldPath newPath outDiffFile -WD -s-64`   
Tip: If you want a more precise match (which might use more memory), you could try changing `-s-64` to `-m-4`   
apply the delta:   
`$hpatchz oldPath diffFile outNewPath`   
Tip: `-WD` format supports multi-thread to speed up patching, for example add `-p-5` parameter (multi-thread not recommended on HDD)   
## Build it yourself
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sisong/HDiffPatch5.git <code_dir>
cd <code_dir>
```
or

```
on MacOS, also can build `HDiffPatch/builds/xcode/HDiffPatch.xcworkspace` by [`xcode`](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)   
   
### Windows ###
build `HDiffPatch/builds/vc/HDiffPatch.sln` by [`Visual Studio`](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
   
### libhpatchz.so for Android ###   
* install [Android NDK](https://developer.android.google.cn/ndk/downloads)
* `$ cd HDiffPatch/builds/android_ndk_jni_mk`
* `$ build_libs.sh`  (or `$ build_libs.bat` on windows, then got \*.so files)
* import file `com/github/sisong/HPatch.java` (from `HDiffPatch/builds/android_ndk_jni_mk/java/`) & .so files, java code can call the patch function in libhpatchz.so

**changed test Program**:   
**hdiffz ...** `-m-6` changed to `-m-2 -cache`, `-s-64` changed to `-s-16`   
**hsynz ...** make `-s-2k` changed to `-s-1k`   
& adding **hsynz p1**, **hsynz p8** make without compressor   
**archive-patcher** v1.0, diff with `--generate --old {old} --new {new} --patch {pat}`,   
  patch with `--apply --old {old} --patch {pat} --new {new}`   
  NOTE: archive-patcher's delta file compressed by lzma2-9-16m, diff&patch time not include compress&decompress delta file's memory&time.   
**sfpatcher -1 zstd** v1.1.1 diff with `-o-1 -c-zstd-21-23 -m-1 -step-3m -lp-512k -p-8 -cache -d {old} {new} {pat}`   
& **sfpatcher -2 lzma2** diff with `-o-2 -c-lzma2-9-4m -m-1 -step-2m -lp-8m -p-8 -cache -d {old} {new} {pat}`   
 sfpatcher patch with `-lp -p-8 {old} {pat} {new}`   
**sfpatcher -1 clA zstd** v1.3.0 used `$sf_normalize -cl-A` normalized apks before diff   
adding test hpatchz v4.6.9 & sfpatcher on Android, arm CPU Kirin980(2×A76 2.6G + 2×A76 1.92G + 4×A55 1.8G)   
( [archive-patcher], [sfpatcher] optimized diff&patch between apk files )
